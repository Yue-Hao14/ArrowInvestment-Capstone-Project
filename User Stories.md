    * I would like to be able to enter my email, first name, last name, username, and preferred password on a clearly laid out form.
    * I would like the website to log me in upon successful completion of the sign-up form.
      * So that I can seamlessly access the site's functionality
  * When I enter invalid data on the sign-up form:
    * I would like the website to inform me of the validations I failed to pass, and repopulate the form with my valid entries (except my password).
